## Why LiteNote

Many to-do and note-taking tools are feature-packed and heavy — not ideal for a sticky-on-desktop quick-capture widget. LiteNote focuses on **local to-do** management: borderless transparent panel, system tray resident, instant toggle with a hotkey. Your data stays on your machine.

## Features

- **Local To-Dos** — SQLite storage with create/edit/delete/complete, pin, priority colors, due dates, and drag-to-reorder

- **Recurring Tasks** — Daily/weekly/monthly repeats with customizable time and target day; auto-advances to the next cycle

- **Due Date Reminders** — Set due dates on tasks; system notification 15 minutes before. Recurring tasks remind per their schedule

- **Week Calendar** — Mon–Sun calendar bar at the top; switch weeks, click a day to filter tasks. Red dot = due tasks, orange dot = overdue

- **Drag-to-Date** — Drag a to-do onto a calendar cell to set its due date instantly

- **Desktop Widget Experience** — Frosted glass transparency, adjustable opacity, always-on-top, minimize to system tray

- **Multiple Themes** — Choose from Glass, Dark, or Light themes; switch instantly with live preview

- **Global Hotkey** — `Ctrl+Shift+L` (`⌘+Shift+L` on macOS) to toggle the main window

- **Inline Settings & About** — All configuration (appearance, theme, language, startup) in a modal dialog; no separate windows

- **Cross-Platform** — Windows (NSIS installer + portable) and macOS (`.app` / `.dmg`)

## Use Cases

- Lightweight to-do list that lives on your desktop
- Quick capture while gaming, watching videos, or working
- Periodic reminders (drink water, weekly meetings, monthly bills, etc.)
- Time-sensitive task reminders with local notifications

## Installation
